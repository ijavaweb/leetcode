## 122. Best time to buy and sell stock 

* **description**

  Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

  Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

  **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

* **solution**

  ```java
  class Solution {
      public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
          int count = 0;
          for(int i = 0;i < prices.length-1; i++){
              if(prices[i+1] > prices[i]){
                  count += prices[i+1] - prices[i];
              }else{
                  continue;
              }
          }
          return count;
      }
  }
  ```
